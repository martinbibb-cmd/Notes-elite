 | shopping around | 🔍 Things to Consider When Shopping Around;
	•	Who actually installs the boiler?;Some online companies and brokers sell the job on to independent fitters. With British Gas, your installation, warranty, and after-care are all handled by one trusted provider.
	•	What does the warranty really cover?;Check whether it’s parts only or full parts and labour. Ours includes a comprehensive warranty and direct support for the lifetime of your boiler, not just the warranty period.
	•	Who do you call if something goes wrong?;A single point of contact avoids being passed between a broker, installer, and manufacturer.;
	•	What’s included in the price?; Make sure system flushes, safety checks, smart controls, and certification are clearly listed. All are included in a British Gas fixed-price installation.
	•	Will they still be around in ten years?; Choosing a long-established company with nationwide coverage means help and spare parts are always available when you need them.
